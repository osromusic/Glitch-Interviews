# Glitch Interviews
Contribute your thoughts on Glitch Art

I am working on a project investigating Glitch Art and I am looking for  contributions.

**My working Thesis:**
> Glitch Art is a methodology for analyzing and interpreting technologies. It explores liminal zones (spaces between function and failure) within technologies and exposes truths about our relationships to these 21st century machines.

**Who are Glitch Artists?** 
> Anyone exploring functions of technologies beyond their intended design. Some of these functions include datamoshing, pixel sorting, and hex hacking, but also include circuit bending, creative coding, sonification and many other practices. Essentially, I understand "Glitch Artists" as anyone exploring processes or outcomes in technologies that reveal new truths, whether intentional or unintentional,  conscious or unconscious.

**So How Can I Help? (you ask yourself)**

I need submissions in any format (more details below) answering some or all of the interview questions. Currently I am working on a documentary, so your submissions may be used for that purpose. If I get a variety of responses and formats I may consider other mediums, like quotes or Podcasts or short videos, etc.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions can be in any format: video, audio, Voice Over, images, text; be creative! Glitch art, digital art, and creative submissions are encouraged. The only suggestion is to maintain the highest fidelity when recording, unless lofi is your goal. Nearly anything visual can be incorporated into video, but poor, low, or distorted dialog is difficult to incorporate.
